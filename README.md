# Melanoma Detection Assignment 
# The assignment will be using multiclass classification model based on a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

Note - The right paths for the data need to be provided in the notebook if the they are not stored as defined in the notebook.

## General Information

The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
Several approaches were undertaken to determine the most suitable model for managing the dataset. We examined different CNN architeture and Data Augmentation approaches.

To run the various models as defined in architecture requires a GPU capable processor so as to reduce the training time.
